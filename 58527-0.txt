     In Holland, at the Hague, you know,
     Well-regulated people go
     To the Hotel Ozanimo.
     (The spelling I've carnegified;
     I often do this on the side).
     Here all Creation lives in peace,
     And therefore Wonders never Cease!

Prefatory Note


These cartoons were made one by one in moments of leisure to please a
small boy. They are now reprinted in the hope of pleasing other small
boys and girls. They were originally in color, but for the present
purpose they have been made over in black and white by a Japanese
artist, who has given them life by occasional quaint touches of his own.

L'Envoi


     I write and paint in doggerel
     Though all the Muses shriek and yell!
     I go serenely on my way
     Not caring what such folks may say!

Eric's Planet


     Eric said to Jupiter:
     "Here I am. Good
       morning, Sir,
     What are your small
       planets worth?
     Give me one. I'll
       take the Earth."

  [Illustration]




The Caravan


     Van! Van! Caravan!
     Who is the camel and
       which is the man?

  [Illustration]




Jack the Rabbit


     Jack the Rabbit
     Has the habit
     When you look him
       in the face
     He is in some other
       place.

  [Illustration]




An Elephant


     I never saw an Elephant
     But that's no symptom
       that I sha'n't.

  [Illustration]




The 'Potamus


     My little 'Potamus and I
     Walk hand in hand when
       roads are dry,
     But when the clouds
       begin to rain,
     I creep into his mouth
       again.

  [Illustration]




My Crocodile


     My Crocodile is good to me—
     He is as nice as he can be;
     But when I go out for a ride,
     I'd rather not come back
       inside.

  [Illustration]




The Giraffe


     If the Giraffe were not so tall
     He'd be an Awful Cannibal,
     But just before he goes to bed
     He sits awhile upon his head.

  [Illustration]




A Goat


     This little beast is called
       a Goat,
     He isn't anything of note,
     But give him a tomato can
     And he's a match for any
       Man.

  [Illustration]




The 'Possum


     The 'Possum sees the
       little boy;
     It does not seem to
       give him joy.

  [Illustration]




Old Sea Catch


     Old Sea Catch comes out
       on the shore
       To Roar,
     And then he thinks it's
       time once more
       To Roar,
     And then he thinks he'll
       have to roar
       Some more!

  [Illustration]




Quail


     I would not like to be a
       Quail,
     And have Salt sprinkled
       on my Tail.

  [Illustration]




The Ptarmigan


     The Ptarmigan lives in
       the Snow;
     Can Eric see him? I
       don't know.

  [Illustration]




The Pelican


     If I were born a Pelican,
     I'd try my best to be a Man!

  [Illustration]




The Man


     If I were born a Man, I'd wish
     I might associate with Fish.

  [Illustration]




The Fish


     If I were born a fish—
       but then,
     No use to wish: Men
       must be Men.

  [Illustration]




The Lion


     The Lion looks like Santa
       Claus,
     I think that this should
       give him paws.
     When he on Lionizing's
       bent,
     He always looks benevolent.

  [Illustration]




Horned Toad


     Phryne is the beast, his name,
     Eric loves him just the same;
     On his back, see, if you please,
     Eric's name in Japanese.

  [Illustration]




A Hospitable Reptile


     This Reptile is a hardened
       sinner;
     But when a friend drops in
       for dinner,
     He greets him with an
       open smile,
     And makes him merry
       quite a while.
     O let us, like this Reptile,
       be
     Renowned for Hospitality!

  [Illustration]




A Social Lobster


     The Lobster's home is in
       the Sea;
     It is as humble as may be.
     But he has wandered far
       afield,
     And now his presence is
       revealed
     Within our best Society.
     This Lesson to us all is
       sent
     To lend us due Encouragement.

  [Illustration]




Cats and Kings


     A Cat may look at any King,
     If he cares for that sort of
       thing;
     And, if he likes the likes of
       that,
     Most any King can see a Cat.

  [Illustration]




Little Children


     Little children at their play,
     Happy, scrappy all the day.

  [Illustration]




Six Kings


     There were six Kings of
       Yvetôt;
     They stood up there all in
       a row,
     And every time they looked
       around
     They cast their eyes upon
       the ground.
     I do not like to look at
       Kings—
     They do such very awful
       things;
     For actions such as this
       must tend
     To make one's hair stand
       up on end!

  [Illustration]




An Aspiring Monkey


     Once a Monkey in Japan
     Vowed his destiny was Man;
     So he climbed up in a tree,
     Then I saw him wink at me.

  [Illustration]




Old Time Folks


     These twain our ancestors
       must be,
     (Arboreal, undoubtedly)
     But this is true; it seems
       to me,
     If Adam looked like this
       and Eve,
     (With no intention to
       deceive)
     Thus in Creation's Rosy
       Dawn,
     I'm glad that I came later
       on.

  [Illustration]




The Wunx


     In their dugout lives the Wunx
     With his jolly family;
     Tasting happiness in chunks,
     Just the same as you and me:
     Not much use the world to
       roam—
     Happiness is found at home.

                (After J. W. R.)

  [Illustration]




Totem Poles


     O, my Prophetic Soul!
     I see a Totem Pole—
     The only Ancient Screed
     That Hempl cannot read!

  [Illustration]




Organ and Organ Man


     The children sing in far Japan;
     The children sing in Spain;
     The organ and the organ man
     Are singing in the rain!

                        R. L. S.

  [Illustration]




In Moonlight


     The squally Cat and squeaky
       Mouse;
     The howly Dog, by the door
       of the house;
     The Bat that hangs to his bed
       till noon,
     They all come out by the light
       of the moon.

                        R. L. S.

  [Illustration]




Hunter and Deer


     "The Hunter still the Deer
       pursues,
     The Hunter and the Deer
       a shade."

  [Illustration]




The Gazelle


     I never loved a fond Gazelle
     But it would jump and snort
       and yell.

  [Illustration]




A Bulldog by the River


     A Bulldog by the river's brim,
     A sinful Bulldog was to him.

  [Illustration]




Squidgecumsquees


     The Cats catch Mice and the
       Goblins chase the Elves,
     But the Squidgecumsquees
       they swallow themselves.

                (After J. W. R.)

  [Illustration]




Road to Mandalay


     On the Road to Mandalay
     Where the Flying Fishes play
     And the Dawn come up like
       thunder
     Out of China, 'cross the Bay.

                           R. K.

  [Illustration]




Mitgard Serpent


     It was the Mitgard Serpient,
     He grabbed the Earth and
       away he went;
     (The Mitgard Serpent was a
       Cat
     With a dozen legs, or about
       like that).
     He swallowed his tail with
       all his might,
     Then spit on his claws and
       held on tight;
     And so the world went round
       all right.
     And 'twas sometimes day and
       sometimes night,
     And 'twas always dark when
       it wasn't light.

  [Illustration]




Saint Georgeing the Dragon


     There once was a brave
       Knight of Pendragon,
     Who tried to Saint George
       an old Dragon;
     But the Dragon had Claws
     At the ends of his Paws,
     (With no adequate Pauses
     At the ends of his Clauses).
     At last when the scrimmage
       was done,
     The Dragon had most of
       the Fun!

  [Illustration]




Flotsam and Jetsam


     There once was a person
       in Spatsum
     Who et some and gave to
       his cat some;
     But just what he et
     That I cannot tell yet,
     But 'twas probably
     Flotsam and Jetsam.

  [Illustration]




The Atoll


     I know a magic circle in the
       Sea
     Etched on the blue with pale
       gray coral sand.
     A mountain sank there once,
       amid the spray,
     Its widening eddies stiffened
       into land
     With lazy surges flapping
       on the strand!

  [Illustration]




Storm Wind


     One day the Storm Wind
       came to town
     And the Barometer went
       down.
     And all the dogs and cats
       had wings—
     And so had all the other
       things.

  [Illustration]




Eric in the Dark


     Little Eric in the dark
     Saw a Boojum and a Snark
     With a bunch of Gobelins;
     Also many other things.
     Such, a small boy sees in
       dreams
     When by night he ups and
       screams.

  [Illustration]




Mars' Stars and Pa's


     The Sun is down,
     The lazy Hound;
     The Moon is up,
     The little Pup.
     I see the Stars;
     One of 'em's Mars,
     I think the others
     Must be Pa's.
     The Stars shine bright,
     I'm sure it's night;
     Then go to bed,
     You sleepy-head!

  [Illustration]




The Porcupine


     The Porcupine's awake at
       Dawn
     To see how Eric's coming on.

  [Illustration]




The Purple Cow


     "I never saw a Purple Cow!"
     How can I paint one? This
       is How!

  [Illustration]




I and Gnu


     When we have nothing else
       to do
     We ride together, I and Gnu;
     And if I'm feeling extra smart,
     I take him spinning in my
       cart!

  [Illustration]




Bobo!


     Comes the Bobo from his lair,
     Cats and squirrels in his hair.
     Eric's not a bit afraid;
     He knows how such beasts
       are made.

  [Illustration]




The Lone Salmon


     Little Eric caught a Salmon
     Wandering through the field!
     Mother said: "It is alarmon'
     What our waters yield."

  [Illustration]




Bean Soup


     Bean soup is bad!
     It makes me mad
     When mother gives such
       stuff to me.
     But when I pour
     It on the floor
     I'm just as happy as I can be.
     When Mother spanks
     I give her thanks,
     Because I know 'tis good
       for me.
     A happy Boy
     Am I. O Joy!
     What time my Daddy
       paints for me!

  [Illustration]




A Lost Shadow


     Eric and his little Shadow
     Went out walking in the
       Meadow.
     Little Shadow got away—
     Haven't seen him since
       that day.

  [Illustration]




The Gazibou


     Here we go, O Gazibou!
     Eric's not afraid of you;
     You may scratch and
       reach and cough
     But you cannot throw
       him off!

In Junglest Africa[A]


     When politicians bungle
     'Tis quiet in the Jungle—
     For all the Beasts are tired
     Because a Man is fired.

     And may the parrot teach us
     This lesson of the hour—
     That going out of Office
     Is going into Power.

Eric Fishing


     Little Eric went a-fishing
     With his rod and line and
       hook,
     And his wishing cap for
       wishing
     Half the minnows in the
       brook.
     This is what he caught by
       wishing:
     Trout and flying-fish and
       whale.
     This is what he caught by
       fishing:
     One small tadpole by the
       tail!

Eric's Bulldog


     Bulldog is a fearsome thing—
     Eric leads him with a string.

The Steering Gear


     Brother Knight pounds away
       with his hammer so gay,
     While Daddy does stunts
       with his pen;
     And mother sits clear at the
       steering gear
     And bosses all three of us
       men.

  [Illustration]




Brother Knight


     Brother Knight is fond of curls;
     Half his ancestors were girls!
     So your daddy says; but, then,
     Half of mine were gentlemen.
     Thus we understand each other
     As a sister does a brother.
     'Tis a combination fine—
     Will you be my Valentine?

  [Illustration]




My Daddy's Family


     Brother Knight, he is all right,
     With Harold, Edith and the
       rest;
     But of all my Daddy's family
     I like myself the best.

  [Illustration]




Christmas Past


     Content am I but just to
       sign the checks;
     Nor wot what mystery is
       brewing next!

  [Illustration]




The Last Act


     Eric's grown up with the
       men;
     He won't need these things
       again.
     Sweep them out! He'll find
       his Joy
     With some other sort of Toy!

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

       Little Incas have long ears,
     May they sleep a thousand years!




AND SO HERE ENDETH "ERIC'S BOOK OF BEASTS" WHICH DAVID STARR JORDAN DID
WITH HIS PEN AND PAINT BOX, BUT THE PICTURES WERE TOO BEE-YOUTIFUL AND
'SPENSIVE; SO HE GOT HIS FRIEND, SHIMADA SEKKO, TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO
CALM BLACK AND WHITE. PAUL ELDER AND COMPANY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE MADE
THEM INTO A BOOK, WITH GREAT GLEE. AT THEIR TOMOYE PRESS JOHN SWART
DESIGNED THE TYPE FACE, AND JEAN OLIVER HELPED WITH THE DECORATIONS—AND
IT WAS ALL FINISHED AND SENT OUT INTO THE WORLD FOR GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS
IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY, 1912

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
