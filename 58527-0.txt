Aux Animaux


     In Holland, at the Hague, you know,
     Well-regulated people go
     To the Hotel Ozanimo.
     (The spelling I've carnegified;
     I often do this on the side).
     Here all Creation lives in peace,
     And therefore Wonders never Cease!

Prefatory Note


These cartoons were made one by one in moments of leisure to please a
small boy. They are now reprinted in the hope of pleasing other small
boys and girls. They were originally in color, but for the present
purpose they have been made over in black and white by a Japanese
artist, who has given them life by occasional quaint touches of his own.

L'Envoi


     I write and paint in doggerel
     Though all the Muses shriek and yell!
     I go serenely on my way
     Not caring what such folks may say!

ERIC'S BOOK OF BEASTS

  [Illustration]




Eric's Planet


     Eric said to Jupiter:
     "Here I am. Good
       morning, Sir,
     What are your small
       planets worth?
     Give me one. I'll
       take the Earth."

  [Illustration]




The Caravan


     Van! Van! Caravan!
     Who is the camel and
       which is the man?

  [Illustration]




Jack the Rabbit


     Jack the Rabbit
     Has the habit
     When you look him
       in the face
     He is in some other
       place.

  [Illustration]




An Elephant


     I never saw an Elephant
     But that's no symptom
       that I sha'n't.

  [Illustration]




The 'Potamus


     My little 'Potamus and I
     Walk hand in hand when
       roads are dry,
     But when the clouds
       begin to rain,
     I creep into his mouth
       again.

  [Illustration]




My Crocodile


     My Crocodile is good to me—
     He is as nice as he can be;
     But when I go out for a ride,
     I'd rather not come back
       inside.

  [Illustration]




The Giraffe


     If the Giraffe were not so tall
     He'd be an Awful Cannibal,
     But just before he goes to bed
     He sits awhile upon his head.

  [Illustration]




A Goat


     This little beast is called
       a Goat,
     He isn't anything of note,
     But give him a tomato can
     And he's a match for any
       Man.

  [Illustration]




The 'Possum


     The 'Possum sees the
       little boy;
     It does not seem to
       give him joy.

  [Illustration]




Old Sea Catch


     Old Sea Catch comes out
       on the shore
       To Roar,
     And then he thinks it's
       time once more
       To Roar,
     And then he thinks he'll
       have to roar
       Some more!

  [Illustration]




Quail


     I would not like to be a
       Quail,
     And have Salt sprinkled
       on my Tail.

  [Illustration]




The Ptarmigan


     The Ptarmigan lives in
       the Snow;
     Can Eric see him? I
       don't know.

  [Illustration]




The Pelican


     If I were born a Pelican,
     I'd try my best to be a Man!

  [Illustration]




The Man


     If I were born a Man, I'd wish
     I might associate with Fish.

  [Illustration]




The Fish


     If I were born a fish—
       but then,
     No use to wish: Men
       must be Men.

  [Illustration]




The Lion


     The Lion looks like Santa
       Claus,
     I think that this should
       give him paws.
     When he on Lionizing's
       bent,
     He always looks benevolent.

  [Illustration]




Horned Toad


     Phryne is the beast, his name,
     Eric loves him just the same;
     On his back, see, if you please,
     Eric's name in Japanese.

  [Illustration]




A Hospitable Reptile


     This Reptile is a hardened
       sinner;
     But when a friend drops in
       for dinner,
     He greets him with an
       open smile,
     And makes him merry
       quite a while.
     O let us, like this Reptile,
       be
     Renowned for Hospitality!

  [Illustration]




A Social Lobster


     The Lobster's home is in
       the Sea;
     It is as humble as may be.
     But he has wandered far
       afield,
     And now his presence is
       revealed
     Within our best Society.
     This Lesson to us all is
       sent
     To lend us due Encouragement.

  [Illustration]




Cats and Kings


     A Cat may look at any King,
     If he cares for that sort of
       thing;
     And, if he likes the likes of
       that,
     Most any King can see a Cat.

  [Illustration]




Little Children


     Little children at their play,
     Happy, scrappy all the day.

  [Illustration]




Six Kings


     There were six Kings of
       Yvetôt;
     They stood up there all in
       a row,
     And every time they looked
       around
     They cast their eyes upon
       the ground.
     I do not like to look at
       Kings—
     They do such very awful
       things;
     For actions such as this
       must tend
     To make one's hair stand
       up on end!

  [Illustration]




An Aspiring Monkey


     Once a Monkey in Japan
     Vowed his destiny was Man;
     So he climbed up in a tree,
     Then I saw him wink at me.

  [Illustration]




Old Time Folks


     These twain our ancestors
       must be,
     (Arboreal, undoubtedly)
     But this is true; it seems
       to me,
     If Adam looked like this
       and Eve,
     (With no intention to
       deceive)
     Thus in Creation's Rosy
       Dawn,
     I'm glad that I came later
       on.

  [Illustration]




The Wunx


     In their dugout lives the Wunx
     With his jolly family;
     Tasting happiness in chunks,
     Just the same as you and me:
     Not much use the world to
       roam—
     Happiness is found at home.

                (After J. W. R.)

  [Illustration]




Totem Poles


     O, my Prophetic Soul!
     I see a Totem Pole—
     The only Ancient Screed
     That Hempl cannot read!

  [Illustration]




Organ and Organ Man


     The children sing in far Japan;
     The children sing in Spain;
     The organ and the organ man
     Are singing in the rain!

                        R. L. S.

  [Illustration]




In Moonlight


     The squally Cat and squeaky
       Mouse;
     The howly Dog, by the door
       of the house;
     The Bat that hangs to his bed
       till noon,
     They all come out by the light
       of the moon.

                        R. L. S.

  [Illustration]




Hunter and Deer


     "The Hunter still the Deer
       pursues,
     The Hunter and the Deer
       a shade."

  [Illustration]




The Gazelle


     I never loved a fond Gazelle
     But it would jump and snort
       and yell.

  [Illustration]




A Bulldog by the River


     A Bulldog by the river's brim,
     A sinful Bulldog was to him.

  [Illustration]




Squidgecumsquees


     The Cats catch Mice and the
       Goblins chase the Elves,
     But the Squidgecumsquees
       they swallow themselves.

                (After J. W. R.)

  [Illustration]




Road to Mandalay


     On the Road to Mandalay
     Where the Flying Fishes play
     And the Dawn come up like
       thunder
     Out of China, 'cross the Bay.

                           R. K.

  [Illustration]




Mitgard Serpent


     It was the Mitgard Serpient,
     He grabbed the Earth and
       away he went;
     (The Mitgard Serpent was a
       Cat
     With a dozen legs, or about
       like that).
     He swallowed his tail with
       all his might,
     Then spit on his claws and
       held on tight;
     And so the world went round
       all right.
     And 'twas sometimes day and
       sometimes night,
     And 'twas always dark when
       it wasn't light.

  [Illustration]




Saint Georgeing the Dragon


     There once was a brave
       Knight of Pendragon,
     Who tried to Saint George
       an old Dragon;
     But the Dragon had Claws
     At the ends of his Paws,
     (With no adequate Pauses
     At the ends of his Clauses).
     At last when the scrimmage
       was done,
     The Dragon had most of
       the Fun!

  [Illustration]




Flotsam and Jetsam


     There once was a person
       in Spatsum
     Who et some and gave to
       his cat some;
     But just what he et
     That I cannot tell yet,
     But 'twas probably
     Flotsam and Jetsam.

  [Illustration]




The Atoll


     I know a magic circle in the
       Sea
     Etched on the blue with pale
       gray coral sand.
     A mountain sank there once,
       amid the spray,
     Its widening eddies stiffened
       into land
     With lazy surges flapping
       on the strand!

  [Illustration]




Storm Wind


     One day the Storm Wind
       came to town
     And the Barometer went
       down.
     And all the dogs and cats
       had wings—
     And so had all the other
       things.

  [Illustration]




Eric in the Dark


     Little Eric in the dark
     Saw a Boojum and a Snark
     With a bunch of Gobelins;
     Also many other things.
     Such, a small boy sees in
       dreams
     When by night he ups and
       screams.

  [Illustration]




Mars' Stars and Pa's


     The Sun is down,
     The lazy Hound;
     The Moon is up,
     The little Pup.
     I see the Stars;
     One of 'em's Mars,
     I think the others
     Must be Pa's.
     The Stars shine bright,
     I'm sure it's night;
     Then go to bed,
     You sleepy-head!

  [Illustration]




The Porcupine


     The Porcupine's awake at
       Dawn
     To see how Eric's coming on.

  [Illustration]




The Purple Cow


     "I never saw a Purple Cow!"
     How can I paint one? This
       is How!

  [Illustration]




I and Gnu


     When we have nothing else
       to do
     We ride together, I and Gnu;
     And if I'm feeling extra smart,
     I take him spinning in my
       cart!

  [Illustration]




Bobo!


     Comes the Bobo from his lair,
     Cats and squirrels in his hair.
     Eric's not a bit afraid;
     He knows how such beasts
       are made.

  [Illustration]




The Lone Salmon


     Little Eric caught a Salmon
     Wandering through the field!
     Mother said: "It is alarmon'
     What our waters yield."

  [Illustration]




Bean Soup


     Bean soup is bad!
     It makes me mad
     When mother gives such
       stuff to me.
     But when I pour
     It on the floor
     I'm just as happy as I can be.
     When Mother spanks
     I give her thanks,
     Because I know 'tis good
       for me.
     A happy Boy
     Am I. O Joy!
     What time my Daddy
       paints for me!

  [Illustration]




A Lost Shadow


     Eric and his little Shadow
     Went out walking in the
       Meadow.
     Little Shadow got away—
     Haven't seen him since
       that day.

  [Illustration]




The Gazibou


     Here we go, O Gazibou!
     Eric's not afraid of you;
     You may scratch and
       reach and cough
     But you cannot throw
       him off!

  [Illustration]




In Junglest Africa[A]


     When politicians bungle
     'Tis quiet in the Jungle—
     For all the Beasts are tired
     Because a Man is fired.

     And may the parrot teach us
     This lesson of the hour—
     That going out of Office
     Is going into Power.


     [A] The cartoon is suggested by one in the "Indianapolis
     News," 1910.

  [Illustration]




Eric Fishing


     Little Eric went a-fishing
     With his rod and line and
       hook,
     And his wishing cap for
       wishing
     Half the minnows in the
       brook.
     This is what he caught by
       wishing:
     Trout and flying-fish and
       whale.
     This is what he caught by
       fishing:
     One small tadpole by the
       tail!

  [Illustration]




Eric's Bulldog


     Bulldog is a fearsome thing—
     Eric leads him with a string.

  [Illustration]




The Steering Gear


     Brother Knight pounds away
       with his hammer so gay,
     While Daddy does stunts
       with his pen;
     And mother sits clear at the
       steering gear
     And bosses all three of us
       men.

  [Illustration]




Brother Knight


     Brother Knight is fond of curls;
     Half his ancestors were girls!
     So your daddy says; but, then,
     Half of mine were gentlemen.
     Thus we understand each other
     As a sister does a brother.
     'Tis a combination fine—
     Will you be my Valentine?

  [Illustration]




My Daddy's Family


     Brother Knight, he is all right,
     With Harold, Edith and the
       rest;
     But of all my Daddy's family
     I like myself the best.

  [Illustration]




Christmas Past


     Content am I but just to
       sign the checks;
     Nor wot what mystery is
       brewing next!

  [Illustration]




The Last Act


     Eric's grown up with the
       men;
     He won't need these things
       again.
     Sweep them out! He'll find
       his Joy
     With some other sort of Toy!

  [Illustration]

  [Illustration]

       Little Incas have long ears,
     May they sleep a thousand years!




AND SO HERE ENDETH "ERIC'S BOOK OF BEASTS" WHICH DAVID STARR JORDAN DID
WITH HIS PEN AND PAINT BOX, BUT THE PICTURES WERE TOO BEE-YOUTIFUL AND
'SPENSIVE; SO HE GOT HIS FRIEND, SHIMADA SEKKO, TO TRANSLATE THEM INTO
CALM BLACK AND WHITE. PAUL ELDER AND COMPANY OF SAN FRANCISCO HAVE MADE
THEM INTO A BOOK, WITH GREAT GLEE. AT THEIR TOMOYE PRESS JOHN SWART
DESIGNED THE TYPE FACE, AND JEAN OLIVER HELPED WITH THE DECORATIONS—AND
IT WAS ALL FINISHED AND SENT OUT INTO THE WORLD FOR GOOD BOYS AND GIRLS
IN THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY, 1912
